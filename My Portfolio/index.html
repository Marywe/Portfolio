                <p> Hello, World! My name is María "Marywe" López, and I'm a passionate videogame developer. </p>
                <p> My primary role in the industry —and the one I'm most passionate about— is Quality Assurance (QA). 
                    I've worked on several projects as a QA, but I also consider myself versatile, as I have contributed to other projects through design, coding, and even modeling.
                    Currently, my three-member team and I are working on creating a board game! </p>
                <p>Additionally, I hold a certificate in Data Analysis, which I hope to leverage to enhance my professional performance. Moreover, 
                    I would love to explore new opportunities as a QA Analyst or Data Analyst within the video game industry. You cand find my final project in Kaggle.</p>
                <p> Playing video games has been my favorite hobby for as long as I can remember. 
                    Since discovering the first video game degree programs I have devoted myself to this field, investing significant time and effort to turn my passion into a career.
                    Every day, I strive to become a better developer. 
                    I continuously learn new techniques and take on small projects to grow and evolve. 
                    Video game development is an incredibly dynamic field with endless possibilities, and I'm proud of what I've achieved so far and excited for what lies ahead. </p>

            <p>Throughout my professional career, I've worked on professional titles like the MMO Temtem (Cremagames) and developed different games with my little team, ranging from board 
                games to casual mobile games and many other genres, with my main roles being a programmer and designer. Moreover, we're dedicating a significant amount of time to one particular project, hoping it will make a notable 
                impact. We're incredibly excited and can't wait to share some spoilers! You can find more of our work on my itch.io page. Meanwhile, here are some of my most important projects. Click them to expand their info!

                    <p>Worked as a QA for two years on the MMO Temtem, by Crema. As part of a small team, each of us managed a wide variety of tasks, including: localization, compatibility, security, regression, functionality, 
                        performance, audiovisual and certification tests. The tests were executed both on PC and console builds, as well as within the game engine. </p>

                        was born. I did some implementation, coding and bug fixing.</p>

                        Since there were no QA courses in the program, the team reached out to me for assistance with the process, so I became the main QA.</p>

                        Even though this was a sophomore project, it was our first game made in Unity and I'm so proud of our work. I did the majority of coding, implementation and some design.</p>
